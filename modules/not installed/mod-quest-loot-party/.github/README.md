[![Build Status](https://github.com/pangolp/mod-quest-loot-party/workflows/core-build/badge.svg?branch=master&event=push)](https://github.com/pangolp/mod-quest-loot-party)

The idea of this simple mod is that by implementing a hook in the emulator, it is possible to modify the drop condition of the quest items. In this way, it is possible that within a group, everyone is able to get the quest item, as long as the npc has a chance to drop it.

I think this way, we encourage more people to play in groups, because before, if we were a group of 5 people doing quests, and we had to get all the necessary items, we had to kill a lot of npc, or directly avoid that kind of quests.

- For this module to work, the following pull request must be approved.
- Until it is in the emulator, it cannot work.
